# ECE 287 PROJECT - FROGGER
Jacob Gardner and Lucian Pfister

All of the verilog files for our project are in the FROGGER_VERILOG_FILES folder.

display.v is the top level module.

To run the project, download the verilog files and run them on a DE2-115 FPGA. 

Once the files are compiled, use the Programmer to load it onto the FPGA. 

It requires the use of a PS2 keyboard to move the frog. 

The numbers on the seven segment displays are how many levels in a row you have gotten to the end of.
