# ECE 287 PROJECT - FROGGER by Jacob Gardner and Lucian Pfister

All of the verilog files for our project are in the FROGGER_VERILOG_FILES folder.

To run the project, download the verilog files and compile them on Quartus, and then use the Programmer to run them on a DE2-115 FPGA.

It requires the use of a PS2 keyboard to move the frog.
